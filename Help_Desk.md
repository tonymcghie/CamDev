#Help Desk info
CAM (or Chemistry Analysis Metadata) is a piece of software that help chemists track their metadata about their sample sets as well as providing some useful tools for chemists to use. Non Chemists with in PFR can enter the details about their Sample Set into CAM the chemists can then see this and do the required analysis and upload their resulting files which the Non Chemists can view and download. CAM uses the PFR user groups to restrict parts of CAM from Non Chemists.
User account are from the PFR userâ€™s database so the user logins are their PFR ones.

For usage issues please contact Tony McGhie. For outages contact Helge Dzierzon, if he is not available you can try Tony.

CAM is run off a Docker image on powerplant, the MySQL database that CAM uses is separate from the Docker image and is also on powerplant. The storage of the data files for CAM is also on powerplant in the http://storage.powerplant.pfr.co.nz/output/chemistry/cam directory.
There is information on how to use CAM in it under the info button on the sidebar.
